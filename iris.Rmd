library(ggplot2)

## Data understanding

First of all, we had an overlook on the data in the dataset: we have 5 variables, 4 of which are numerical refering to size, and the remaining one refers to the flower species:

```{r iris}
summary(iris)
```

To make it more visual and easy to digest we'll plot this information into graphs:

```{r iris2, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = iris$Sepal.Width)) + geom_histogram(stat_bin(bins=30)) 

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
